# Skoog Family — Titanic Data Storytelling & Analysis


A historical deep dive into the fate of one Swedish family aboard the RMS Titanic, blending storytelling with data science.


### 📖 Project Overview:


On April 10, 1912, the Skoog family — Wilhelm, his wife Anna, and their four children — boarded the RMS Titanic in Southampton, England, holding third-class tickets and dreams of a new life in America.

Five nights later, the Titanic struck an iceberg, and history changed forever.
This project uses the Titanic(train.csv) dataset from kaggle to recreate the Skoog family’s journey, combining data storytelling with data analysis to uncover:

How third-class passengers were impacted during the disaster.
What factors influenced survival rates.
How data visualization can bring historical events to life.


### 🎯 Objectives:

Transform historical passenger data into a narrative-driven analysis.

Explore the Skoog family’s demographics and travel conditions.

Use data science tools to analyze survival patterns.

Create visuals that blend history and data insight.


### 🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and storytelling

GitHub for version control & portfolio presentation


### 📊 Key Insights:

- Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rate, especially large families.
- Gender and age significantly influenced survival probability.
- The Skoog family’s fate highlights the human side of data — not just numbers, but lives.
